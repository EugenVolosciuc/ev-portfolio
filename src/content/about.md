# A little about me

**Hi, I'm Eugen**. I'm a web developer working on both frontend and backend with over 4+ years of experience in a wide range of digital products. I've got a diverse set of skills, ranging from React, Redux, NextJS, Ant Design, ChakraUI and other frontend libraries to NodeJS, Express, Prisma, AWS, tRPC etc. I like my code typed, so I'm a big advocate for Typescript.

I have a serious passion for technology, interested in the frontend spectrum and working on ambitious projects with positive people. Throughout the years I gathered knowledge while working at multiple companies. I'm currently working remotely at [TechQuarter](https://www.techquarter.io/), an agency based in Cluj, Romania.

When I'm not thinking about how to create the next unicorn, I'm spending time with my family: my wonderful wife and our two cats - Otto and Mina. I'm fond of Japanese culture, learned the language for around two years but left it aside because of time constraints, unfortunately.
